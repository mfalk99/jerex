Japan 's territorial waters extend to three nautical miles ( 5.6   km ) into the strait instead of the usual twelve , reportedly to allow nuclear - armed United States Navy warships and submarines to transit the strait without violating Japan 's prohibition against nuclear weapons in its territory . The part of the Seikan Tunnel that passes under the strait is considered to be under Japanese sovereignty . The part of the Tsugaru Strait considered to be in international waters is still within Japan 's exclusive economic zone . The Tsugaru Strait has eastern and western necks , both approximately 20   km across with maximum depths of 200 m and 140 m respectively . In the past , the most common way for passengers and freight to cross the strait was by the Seikan ferry , approximately a four - hour journey . On September 26 , 1954 , 1,172 lives were lost when the ferry Tōya Maru sank in the strait .

The story follows Mario 's quest to save Princess Toadstool and Dinosaur Land from the series antagonist Bowser and his children , the Koopalings . The gameplay is similar to that of earlier Super Mario games : Players control Mario or his brother Luigi through a series of levels in which the goal is to reach the flagpole at the end . Super Mario World introduced Yoshi , a dinosaur who can eat enemies and gain abilities by eating the shells of Koopa Troopas . Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development developed the game , led by director Takashi Tezuka and producer and series creator Shigeru Miyamoto . It is the first Mario game for the SNES and was designed to make the most of the console 's technical features . The development team had more freedom compared to the series instalments for the Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ) . Yoshi was conceptualised during the development of the NES games but was not used until Super Mario World due to hardware limitations . Super Mario World is often considered one of the greatest video games of all time . It sold over 20 million copies worldwide , making it the bestselling SNES game . It also led to an animated television series of the same name and a prequel , Yoshi 's Island , released in August and October 1995 . It has been rereleased on multiple occasions : It was part of the 1994 compilation Super Mario All - Stars + Super Mario World for the SNES and was rereleased for the Game Boy Advance as Super Mario World : Super Mario Advance 2 in 2001 , on the Virtual Console for the Wii , <span class="head"><span class="type">MISC</span>Wii U</span> , and New Nintendo 3DS consoles , and as part of the Super NES Classic Edition .</td>

The modern Mustansiriyah University was established with the help and financial support of the Republic of Ίrāq Teacher ’s Union in 1963 , mainly providing evening courses . In 1964 , the University was given the status of a semi - state institution and some state financial support . At the same time it absorbed Al - Sha’ab University , another private university that had been founded by the Ίrāqi Association of Economists , and then moved to a new campus to the north of the city centre . Initially , the University also managed colleges in Mosul and Basra . In 1966 a law was passed under which the private universities were converted into public universities .

Bebop developed as the younger generation of jazz musicians expanded the creative possibilities of jazz beyond the popular , dance - oriented swing style with a new " musician 's music " that was not as danceable and demanded close listening . As bebop was not intended for dancing , it enabled the musicians to play at faster tempos . Bebop musicians explored advanced harmonies , complex syncopation , altered chords , extended chords , chord substitutions , asymmetrical phrasing , and intricate melodies . Bebop groups used rhythm sections in a way that expanded their role . Whereas the key ensemble of the swing era was the big band of up to fourteen pieces playing in an ensemble - based style , the classic bebop group was a small combo that consisted of saxophone ( alto or tenor ) , trumpet , piano , double bass , and drums playing music in which the ensemble played a supportive role for soloists . Rather than play heavily arranged music , bebop musicians typically played the melody of a song ( called the " head " ) with the accompaniment of the rhythm section , followed by a section in which each of the performers improvised a solo , then returned to the melody at the end of the song . Some of the most influential bebop artists , who were typically composer - performers , are : tenor sax players Dexter Gordon , Sonny Rollins , and James Moody ; alto sax player Charlie Parker ; trumpeters Fats Navarro , Clifford Brown , and Dizzy Gillespie ; pianists Bud Powell , Mary Lou Williams , and Thelonious Monk ; electric guitarist Charlie Christian , and drummers <span class="head"><span class="type">PER</span>Kenny Clarke</span> , Max Roach , and Art Blakey .</td>

Nearby is the Vaal Dam , from which the massive PWV megalopolis ( Pretoria , Witwatersrand and Vereeniging ) draws its water . The PWV forms the urban heart of Gauteng province . The Witwatersrand is the name given to the area that comprises the Greater Johannesburg metropole and the gold - bearing reef along which gold was discovered in 1886 . The Vaal Dam is well - patronised by people from Johannesburg over the weekends and during holidays , as it provides extensive water recreation facilities some 70   km south of the city .</td>

                <td class="doc-text">The grenade , hand , anti - tank No . 74 , commonly known as the S.T. grenade or sticky bomb , was a British hand grenade designed and produced during the <span class="tail"><span class="type">MISC</span>Second World War</span> . The grenade was one of a number of anti - tank weapons developed for use by the <span class="head"><span class="type">ORG</span>British Army</span> and Home Guard as an ad hoc solution to a lack of sufficient anti - tank guns in the aftermath of the Dunkirk evacuation . Designed by a team from MIR(c ) including Major Millis Jefferis and Stuart Macrae , the grenade consisted of a glass sphere containing an explosive made of nitroglycerin and additives ( this added stability to the mix , as well as giving it its squash - head - like effect ) covered in a strong adhesive and surrounded by a sheet - metal casing . When the user pulled a pin on the handle of the grenade , the casing would fall away and expose the sticky sphere . Pulling another pin would arm the firing mechanism and the user would then attempt to attach the grenade to an enemy tank or other vehicle . Letting go of the handle would release a lever that would activate a five - second fuse , which would then detonate the nitroglycerin . The grenade had several faults with its design . In tests , it failed to adhere to dusty or muddy tanks and , if the user was not careful after freeing the grenade from its casing , it could easily stick to his uniform . The Ordnance Board of the War Department did not approve the grenade for use by the <span class="head"><span class="type">ORG</span>British Army</span> , but personal intervention by the prime minister , Winston Churchill , led to the grenade going into production . Between 1940 and 1943 , approximately 2.5 million were produced . It was primarily issued to the Home Guard , but was also used by British and Commonwealth forces in North Africa , accounting for six German tanks ; used by Allied Forces on the Anzio Beachhead , including the First Special Service Force ; as well as by Australian Army units during the New Guinea campaign . The French Resistance were also issued a quantity of the grenades .</td>
